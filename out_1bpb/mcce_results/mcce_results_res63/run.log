|    MCCE (Multi-Conformation Continuum Electrostatics)       |
|	is a program developed at Marilyn Gunner's lab.	      |
|	MCCE is a biophysics simulation program combining     |
|	continuum electrostatics and molecular mechanics.     |
|	In this program, the protein side chain motions are   |
|	simulated explicitly while the dielectric effect of   |
|	solvent and bulk protein material is modeled by	      |
|	continuum electrostatics.			      |
|	MCCE can calculate residue pka, cofactor Em and       |
|	protein PI in protein-solvent systems, and more:      |
|							      |
|	 - Protein structural responses to changes in charge  |
|	 - Changes in charge state of ionizable residues due  |
|	   to structural changes in the protein		      |
|	 - The structural and ionization changes caused by    |
|	   changes in solution pH or Eh			      |
|	 - Find the location and stoichiometry of proton      |
|	   transfers coupled to electron transfer	      |
|	 - Make side chain rotomer packing predictions as     |
|	   a function of pH				      |
